This is another dynamic programming problem using a target string and a String[] 
holding a set of words.

If interest I would recommend to watch the video on YouTube.
This problem is around 02:30:00 in the video.

If interest in my comments I invite you to read the following post in my blog:

Remember that one of the best ways to learn is to read and experiment.
In addition repetition helps a lot.
The autor of the video is much aware of repetition as a tool to teach.

Enjoy;
